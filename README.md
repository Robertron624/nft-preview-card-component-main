## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What to do when I need a centered element that is child of an absolute positioned element as its the case of the hero overlay
and the eye icon inside it.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on complex layouts and not just individual components or maybe components that need some kind of interactivity.
